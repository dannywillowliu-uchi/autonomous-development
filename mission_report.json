  "objective": "Add traceability and dashboard features to mission control. The system currently has no persistent mission state file and the live dashboard doesn't show the mission objective or planned work. Fix both.\n\n1. MISSION_STATE.md GENERATION: At mission start, auto-generate a MISSION_STATE.md file in the project root. Contents: mission objective, discovered/planned work items with status (pending/in_progress/completed/failed), timestamps for each state transition. Update this file throughout execution as units complete or fail. Commit it with each green-branch push so the file is always in sync with code. The file should be human-readable markdown with a clear structure.\n\n2. MISSION_STATE.md UPDATES: Hook into the continuous controller's unit completion/failure handlers to update MISSION_STATE.md in real-time. Each update should append to a log section showing what changed and when. Include the git commit hash for completed units.\n\n3. DASHBOARD MISSION STATEMENT: Add a mission objective section to the live web dashboard (live_ui.html). Display the current mission objective prominently at the top of the page, above the status bar. Show it in a styled card/banner that's always visible. If no mission is running, show \"No active mission.\"\n\n4. DASHBOARD WORK ITEMS VIEW: Add a planned work items section to the dashboard that shows each work unit with its current status (planned/running/completed/failed), the worker assigned to it, and timestamps. This should update in real-time via the existing WebSocket connection. Style with color-coded status badges.\n\n5. DASHBOARD MISSION HISTORY: Add a collapsible section that shows past mission summaries -- objective, total units, pass/fail counts, duration, and a link to the mission report. Pull data from the SQLite database.\n\nEach unit: implement the feature, add tests, ensure all existing tests pass. Focus on clean integration with existing code rather than new abstractions.",
