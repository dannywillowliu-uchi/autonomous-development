objective = """Improve the live mission control dashboard UI (src/mission_control/dashboard/live_ui.html) for better human readability and usability. Focus areas:

1. LAYOUT & RESPONSIVENESS: Improve the CSS grid layout for different screen sizes. The 3-column layout (plan tree, worker cards, event log) should collapse gracefully on smaller screens. Add proper scrolling to each panel independently.

2. WORKER CARD UX: Make worker cards more informative -- show elapsed time for running units (live counter), display file paths as clickable links, add a progress indicator for attempt count (e.g., "Attempt 2/3"), use more distinctive visual states (icons, borders, animations for running units).

3. EVENT LOG: Improve the event timeline -- add relative timestamps ("2m ago"), color-code by severity, group related events (e.g., dispatch+merge for same unit), add filtering by event type.

4. PLAN TREE: Make the plan tree more visual -- add progress bars for epochs showing completion %, use indentation and tree lines, show unit duration alongside status, make nodes expandable with details.

5. CONTROL BAR: Improve the control bar UX -- add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (stop, cancel), show feedback when signals are sent, disable buttons when no mission is active, add keyboard shortcuts (p=pause, s=stop).

Each unit: modify live_ui.html only, keep it self-contained (no build step), ensure all existing tests pass. Read MISSION_STATE.md for completed work."""
