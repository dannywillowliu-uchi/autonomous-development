# Mission State
Objective: Continue with 5 remaining backlog items. Top priorities: [quality] Add end-to-end integration test for the dispatch-merge-complete cycle (priority=7.2); [feature] Add backlog staleness detection with eviction and reprioritization (priority=7.2); [quality] Fix semaphore recreation bug that silently breaks worker count adjustment (priority=7.2)

## Remaining
The planner should focus on what hasn't been done yet.
Do NOT re-target files in the 'Files Modified' list unless fixing a failure.
