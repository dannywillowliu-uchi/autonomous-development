# Mission State
Objective: Work through the priority backlog. Top items:

1. P4 - EMA BUDGET TRACKING: Implement exponential moving average cost tracking per work unit. Add EMA module with alpha=0.3, outlier dampening (>3x EMA clamped to 2x), conservatism factor (k=1.0+0.5/sqrt(n)). Wire into _should_stop() in continuous_controller.py. Add adaptive cooldown that increases when costs exceed budget. Add comprehensive tests.

2. P6 - TYPED CONTEXT STORE: Replace flat text memory.py with structured ContextItem dataclass backed by SQLite. Add scope-based filtering (mission, round, unit). Support selective injection into worker prompts based on relevance. Add tests.

3. QUALITY FIXES from backlog: Replace silent 'except Exception: pass' patterns with logged catches. Add cost accumulation resilience. Sanitize brace characters in worker prompt .format() inputs. Fix semaphore private attribute manipulation.

Each unit: implement the feature, add tests, ensure all existing tests pass. Read BACKLOG.md for full specs.

Priority backlog items to address:
1. [quality] Extract unit event logging into a helper to eliminate 8 duplicate try/except blocks (backlog_item_id=ca488f0ac67a, priority=6.3): In continuous_controller.py, there are 8 identical blocks that follow this pattern: `try: self.db.insert_unit_event(UnitEvent(...)) except Exception: pass`. These appear at lines 782-789, 1001-1011, 1038-1050, 1082-1091, 1112-1124, 1273-1282, 1342-1345, and the event_stream emit that follows each. Extract into a `_log_unit_event(self, mission_id, epoch_id, unit_id, event_type, *, details=None, input_tokens=0, output_tokens=0, cost_usd=0.0)` method that handles both the DB insert and event stream emit in one call with proper exception logging (`logger.debug` with exc binding). This removes ~80 lines of duplicated boilerplate.
2. [security] Fix semaphore private attribute manipulation in _handle_adjust_signal (backlog_item_id=6593270e1cce, priority=5.6): In continuous_controller.py:1694, _handle_adjust_signal directly mutates asyncio.Semaphore._value (a private CPython implementation detail) to account for in-flight tasks when dynamically resizing the worker pool. This bypasses the Semaphore's internal synchronization and is fragile across Python versions. Replace with a proper pattern: create a new BoundedSemaphore, track in-flight count via an atomic counter (self._in_flight_count incremented on dispatch, decremented in _on_task_done), and only allow new dispatches when in_flight < new_count. This avoids relying on undocumented internals.
3. [feature] Add mission-level error budget tracking with automatic degradation (backlog_item_id=33e710b40ab6, priority=5.6): Add a simple error budget mechanism to ContinuousController: track consecutive DB write failures via a counter (self._db_error_count). When it exceeds a threshold (configurable, default 5), log at ERROR level and enter degraded mode where non-critical DB writes (unit_events, worker heartbeats, strategic context) are skipped while critical writes (unit status transitions, merge results) still attempt. Reset the counter on any successful DB write. Add a `db_errors` field to ContinuousMissionResult so the post-mission summary reports total DB errors encountered. This implements the circuit breaker pattern from the error handling research without the complexity of a full retry framework.
4. [security] Fix semaphore private attribute manipulation in _handle_adjust_signal (backlog_item_id=8d2efc4cd16a, priority=5.6): In continuous_controller.py:1694, _handle_adjust_signal directly mutates asyncio.Semaphore._value (a private CPython implementation detail) to account for in-flight tasks when dynamically resizing the worker pool. This bypasses the Semaphore's internal synchronization and is fragile across Python versions. Replace with a proper pattern: create a new BoundedSemaphore, track in-flight count via an atomic counter (self._in_flight_count incremented on dispatch, decremented in _on_task_done), and only allow new dispatches when in_flight < new_count. This avoids relying on undocumented internals.
5. [feature] Add mission-level error budget tracking with automatic degradation (backlog_item_id=7f636ca9bf03, priority=5.6): Add a simple error budget mechanism to ContinuousController: track consecutive DB write failures via a counter (self._db_error_count).
