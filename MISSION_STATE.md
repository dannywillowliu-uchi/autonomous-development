# Mission State
Objective: Enable parallel worker dispatch within epochs: wire continuous_controller dispatch loop to concurrently spawn workers on independent units (same topological layer, no file overlap), gated by workspace pool capacity and circuit breakers

## Remaining
The planner should focus on what hasn't been done yet.
Do NOT re-target files in the 'Files Modified' list unless fixing a failure.
