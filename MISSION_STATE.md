# Mission State
Objective: [CLEANUP] Consolidate test suite: 68 files, 0 tests. Merge test files for the same module, consolidate small test classes, remove dead code. All tests must pass.

## Remaining
The planner should focus on what hasn't been done yet.
Do NOT re-target files in the 'Files Modified' list unless fixing a failure.
